# Project for class Computer Intelligence (AI)
# Fake News Detection
This project aims to detect fake news from various texts using different models for training and evaluation.

## Models Used:
- Naive Bayes
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Data
The dataset for this project is sourced from Kaggle.com

## Instructions
- Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data by removing unnecessary characters, symbols, and stop words. Apply lemmatization to reduce words to their base forms.
- Model Training: Train the models using the preprocessed data.
- Evaluation: Evaluate the models using metrics such as precision, accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- NLTK for natural language processing
- scikit-learn for preprocessing, evaluation, and SVM training
- Keras for preprocessing, evaluation, and CNN implementation
